# Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core 1.0 MVC demos

### Description
This repository contains the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC examples built against ASP.NET Core 1.0 preliminary releases (betas and RCs).

Normally we distribute this example project via our bundles, but the fast-paced release cycle of ASP.NET Core 1.0 MVC makes this impractical.

Furthermore, publishing this in the open might be useful for anyone that is building sites agains the ASP.NET Core 1.0 MVC preliminary builds.

This repository will remain live until ASP.NET Core 1.0 goes official.

### Releases
